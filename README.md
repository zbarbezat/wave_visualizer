# Musical Wave Visualizer
## PHYS175 Light and Sound Project by Zak Barbezat and Daniel Sipe
### Project Description
Create a web app that allows a user to visualize the waveforms of musical pitches, 
intervals, and chords through an interactive piano keyboard interface

### Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* CSS
* data URIs

### Generating Sound
JavaScript has a Math.sin() function. Not only will this be used to visualize the different chords,
but also can be used to generate the sounds using dataURIs.

I imagine having multiple waves at once could be a potential issue.

### Creating the interface
basic vanilla JS and CSS we can draw a keyboard and have the user interact with it. There will be a
square on the side next to the piano with a graph that updates with the sine wave of whatever the
keyboard will be playing.

I don't know exactly how JavaScript's math functions work. If we can just 'add' sine functions together
then this shouldn't be *that* difficult. If not then this will also be a pain.

Also animating the sine wave is something I want to do. This might be too difficult. We'll see how we're
feeling by thte time we get to that point.
